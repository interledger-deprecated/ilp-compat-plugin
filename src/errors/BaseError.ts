/**
 * Extensible error class.
 *
 * The built-in Error class is not actually a constructor, but a factory. It
 * doesn't operate on `this`, so if we call it as `super()` it doesn't do
 * anything useful.
 *
 * Nonetheless it does create objects that are instanceof Error. In order to
 * easily subclass error we need our own base class which mimics that behavior
 * but with a true constructor.
 *
 * Note that this code is specific to V8 (due to `Error.captureStackTrace`).
